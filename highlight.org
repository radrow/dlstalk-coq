* Theorem

Things completely crucial to the point.


* Proposition

Important steps in proving Theorems. They should generally be mentioned in informal proofs.


* Lemma

- Intermediate steps in proving other things, with little value on their own.
- Things that are easy to prove on paper, but annoying in Coq.
- If you would leave it as an "exercise for the reader", most likely it goes here.


* Corollary


Simplified or reduced versions of Theorems.


* Property

All "unpacking" lemmas, where there is a clear owner of the property. Proofs should be simple, ideally max induction+inversion.


* Fact

Things of zero value to the reader. All obvious, purely technical and Coq-quirky items should go here. For example rewrite lemmas.


* Remark

Any "btw" steps which only a human would care for.
